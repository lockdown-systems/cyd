Tech platforms can't be trusted. It's time to regain control of your data. [Cyd](https://cyd.social/) is an open source app for Windows, Mac, and Linux that lets you back up and selectively delete your data, and migrate it to open platforms.

At the moment, Cyd supports the following platforms:

- X (formerly Twitter)
- _More platforms coming soon..._

## Get started
