# What is Cyd for Teams?

If you run a business or an organization and would like to give your employees privacy, peace of mind, and protection from doxing and harassment (*ehem*, newsrooms and non-profits, I'm looking at you), then Cyd for Teams is for you.

Cyd for Teams gives you central management and billing of Premium plans for everyone at your organization. You can invite individual people to your plan, or you can allowlist a domain name so that anyone who signs up with an email address from your organization gets a Premium account automatically. Seats are transferrable, so if one employee leaves you can give that seat to the next person without needing to buy new seat.

If you'd like to sign up for Cyd for Teams, see [Sign Up](./sign-up).
