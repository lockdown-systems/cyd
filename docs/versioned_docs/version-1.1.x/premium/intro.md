# What are Premium Plans?

Cyd is an [open source app](https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd) that allows you to delete all of your tweets for free. You can also save backups of your tweets, direct messages, likes, bookmarks, and retweets free of charge. [Download the Cyd app](https://cyd.social/download/) to get started.

If you'd like to delete your likes, bookmarks and direct messages, to mass unfollow everyone, or to migrate your tweets to Bluesky before deleting them, you can do so with a Premium plan. We keep Cyd very affordable â€” about half the price of a cup of coffee each month.

Check out the [Pricing page](https://cyd.social/pricing/) for more information. You can also [sign up for Premium](./sign-up) directly.

If you're part of an organization and you think Premium accounts would be useful for your members, check out [Cyd for Teams](../cyd-for-teams/intro).

Cyd is developed by the [Lockdown Systems Collective](https://lockdown.systems), a worker-owned cooperative.
