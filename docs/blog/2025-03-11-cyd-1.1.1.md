**We're pleased to announce Cyd 1.1.1 is released.** This is a minor release. Here's what's new:

- Docs: The docs website (that's this website!) now has privacy-friendly [Plausible analytics](https://plausible.io/) so we can see what pages are getting read ([#444](https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd/pull/444))
- Bug fix: When connecting a Bluesky account, your handle can start with the `@` character ([#450](https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd/pull/450))
- Bug fix: If initializing the Bluesky client fails, delete the state/session and try again ([#453](https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd/pull/453))
- We updated Node.js dependencies ([#452](https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd/pull/452))

See the [release on GitHub](https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd/releases/tag/v1.1.1).
