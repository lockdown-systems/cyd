# What are Premium Plans?

Cyd is developed by the [Lockdown Systems Collective](https://lockdown.systems), a worker-owned cooperative. Because we believe that humans deserve to get paid for their labor, and because we'd like to opportunity to make a comfortable living contunually developing and adding new features to Cyd, we've decided to run Lockdown Systems as a business.

Even though Cyd is open source &mdash; you can check out the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd) &mdash; only some of its features are free. Other features, such as migrating your tweets to Bluesky, require a Premium plan.

You can [download the Cyd app](https://cyd.social/download/) for free, and you can use it without buying anything or signing up for an account. If you try to use a Premium feature, you will be prompted to sign up and pay for a Premium plan.

Check out the [Pricing page](https://cyd.social/pricing/) for details on how much Premium plans cost and what features they include. We keep Cyd very affordable &mdash; about half the price of a cup of coffee each month.

We also are actively working with progressive organizations to give free and discounted Premium plans to vulnerable users who need them.

If you'd like to sign up for a Premium plan, see [Sign Up for Premium](./sign-up).

If you're part of an organization and you think Premium accounts would be useful for your members, check out [Cyd for Teams](../cyd-for-teams/intro).
