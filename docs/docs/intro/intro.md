# Welcome to Cyd

Cyd is an open source app for Windows, Mac, and Linux that makes it easy for you to claw back your data from Big Tech platforms. Right now Cyd supports X, but more platforms (*cough Facebook cough*) are coming soon.

Cyd helps you create a local, private backup of your data &mdash; like all of your tweets, retweets, likes, bookmarks, and direct messages. Once you've done this, Cyd helps you choose what data you want to delete from your online account. You can delete it all, or you can be selective, deleting most of it but keeping what went viral.

Cyd can also help you migrate your data from closed platforms into open ones &mdash; for example, you can migrate your tweets from X into Bluesky.

> Want to delete all of your tweets? Cyd, an application for Windows, macOS, and Linux, automates the process for you and even gives you an offline archive. Even better: This application runs entirely on your computer, meaning you don't need to trust a third party with access to your account in order to use it.

> Just as journalists are making the jump to Bluesky, it’s become easier than ever to remove old posts on X. Our former board member Micah Lee created a new piece of software called Cyd, which helps you remove your data from X, with plans to extend this functionality to other social media sites like Facebook and Reddit. Instead of using the old developer tools, which have become prohibitively expensive in recent years, Cyd bypasses these limitations by essentially doing what any user would have to do manually in their browser: The software scrolls through the website and clicks the “delete” button, over and over again.
