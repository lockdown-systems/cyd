# Introduction

Cyd stores the data from your X account &mdash; your tweets, likes, bookmarks, direct messages, and so on &mdash; in a local database in the `Documents` folder on your computer.

Before deleting your tweets, or migrating them to Bluesky, you need to create a local database of your data. When you instruct Cyd to delete tweets, it will reference this database. If you've built your database before, you can update it with the latest data from your X account by building it again.

There are three different ways of building your local database:

- [Build Database from Scratch](./build): Cyd can scroll through your data to discover it.
- [Import X Archive](./import): You can import an official archive from X.
- [Save HTML Tweets, DMs, and/or Bookmarks](./archive): Cyd can scroll through your data to import types of data that aren't included in the official archive.
