# Other Tweets

As Cyd scrolls through your list of tweets or likes, X's website gives it a stream of tweets to save. Most of these tweets will be your actual tweets, retweets, or likes, but sometimes you get some other tweets too:

- You might get other people's replies to your tweets
- You might someone's reply to a tweet that you liked
- If you liked a tweet in a thread, you might get the top tweet in that thread
- X works in mysterious ways, so there might be [ghost likes](./ghost-likes) in there too

While the "other tweets" are saved in your local database, they do not appear in the HTML archive that Cyd creates for you.
