# What are Premium Plans?

Cyd is developed by the [Lockdown Systems Collective](https://lockdown.systems), a worker-owned cooperative. Even though it's open source &mdash; you can check out the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/lockdown-systems/cyd) &mdash; some of the features cost money. By running the collective as a sustainable business, we can make a living continually improving Cyd.

You can [download the Cyd app](https://cyd.social/download/) for free, and you can use it without buying anything or signing up for an account. If you try to use a premium feature, you will be prompted to sign up and pay for a Premium plan.

In general, the features that help you to save copies of your data are free, and the features that help you delete your data require a Premium plan. We make some exceptions to this though. For example, it's free to delete all of your tweets from X, but you'll need a Premium plan if you want to choose to keep the ones that went viral.

Check out the [Pricing page](https://cyd.social/pricing/) for details on how much Premium plans cost and what features they include. We try to keep it very affordable &mdash; about half the price of a cup of coffee each month.
