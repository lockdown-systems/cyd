Open Cyd. Click the **View** menu, and choose **Toggle Developer Tools**.

Whenever Cyd does anything, it will output logs to the Console. And if Cyd encounters an error, an error message will be printed in the Console too.

To save a copy of your console log, right-click in the Console panel and choose **Save as...**. You can save a log file, which you can then email to us. You can also take a screenshot of the error you're encountering and email that to us.
