# What is Cyd for Teams?

If you run a business or an organization and would like to give your employees privacy, peace of mind, and protection from doxing and harassment (*ehem*, newsrooms, I'm looking at you), then Cyd for Teams is for you.

Cyd for Teams gives you central management and billing of Premium plans for everyone at your organization. You can invite individual people to your plan, or anyone who signs up with Cyd using an email address from your organization's domain they can get added automatically. Seats are transferrable, so if one employee leaves you can give that seat to the next person without needing to buy new seat.

To get started, load the [Cyd for Teams page](https://dash.cyd.social/#/teams/new) on the Cyd Dashboard. If you don't have a Cyd account yet, create one by entering your email address. From there, you can create a new organization and sign up for a Cyd for Teams plan.
